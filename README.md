# Day-9-of-Learning-Java
In the day 9 I have learn about the FILE HANDELLING and made the program based on {Creating a File, Deleting a File, Updating the details in File and Displaying the Details of File }.

The problems are as following:-

Q1. Demonstrate a Java program with the class name FileHandlingExample to perform the following file handling operations:
    i. Create a new file named test.txt.
    ii. Write initial content to the file.
    iii. Read and display the content of the file.
    iv. Append additional text to the existing file.
    v. Count and display the total number of words in the file.
    vi. Delete the file.
    
Q2. Write a Java program with the class name Handle6 to create a new file named project.txt using the File class. Use proper exception handling with throws IOException. Do 
    not write any content to the file — just create the empty file.
    
Q3. Demonstrate a Java program to count the total number of lines and words in a text file named notes.txt. The program should read the file, iterate through each line, and 
    calculate:
    • Total number of lines
    • Total number of words (consider words separated by spaces).
    Handle exceptions properly in case the file is not found.
    
Q4. Demonstrate a Java program to read a file and display the following details:
    • File name
    • File absolute path
    • Whether the file is readable
    • Whether the file is writable
    • File length in bytes
    • Finally, attempt to delete the file and display the status
Use appropriate methods from the File class to perform these operations. Handle the case where the file does not exist.
